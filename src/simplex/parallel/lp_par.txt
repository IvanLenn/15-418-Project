Each processor will store a chunk of constraints.
The target will store in process 0
All inputs are sent into process 0
All 2D array are stored in a contiguous fashion (MatrixData is real data, Matrix is to make it 2D)

Fix:
lp_par1.cpp Line 144 not mallocing a new array everytime? Store everything in buffer
lp_par1.cpp Do we need to maintain basic and nonbasic for every processor?
lp_par1.cpp Line 141 2 Bcast
lp_par1.cpp Line 294 and others: 1D array can use vector.data() to transfer?
