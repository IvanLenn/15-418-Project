Each processor will store a chunk of constraints.
The target will store in process 0
All inputs are sent into process 0
All 2D array are stored in a contiguous fashion (MatrixData is real data, Matrix is to make it 2D)

Fix:
Line 144 not mallocing a new array everytime? Store everything in buffer
Do we need to maintain basic and nonbasic for every processor?
Line 141 2 Bcast
